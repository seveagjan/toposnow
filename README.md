# toposnow

The toposnow project investigates the topographic control on summer snow cover in the Dry Andes with Sentinel-2 and SRTM elevation data.
It follows the central research question on the relationship between summer snow cover (SSC) distribution and terrain parameters. The Cord√≥n del Plata mountain range being characterized by an arid climate and a spatially fragmented continous snow cover, will serve as a test site. Knowledge about the spatial distribution of snow cover that is majorly governed by topography is essential for freshwater management in dry regions.
